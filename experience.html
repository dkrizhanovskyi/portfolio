        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> August 2024 - Present</p> 
        <p><strong>Location:</strong> Zurich, Switzerland · Remote</p> 
        <p>As an Independent Researcher, I specialize in the development and exploration of advanced quantum cryptography techniques. My current focus is on designing quantum encryption algorithms that leverage the principles of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement, to achieve levels of security unattainable by classical encryption methods. I work on developing modular, scalable architectures that can be adapted and optimized for implementation on near-term quantum hardware. My research is self-directed and self-funded, allowing me to pursue cutting-edge topics in quantum computing and cryptography. I am actively seeking collaboration opportunities to further validate and enhance my research through practical applications and testing on quantum systems.</p>
